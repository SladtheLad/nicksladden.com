  `Howdy. I'm Nick. I'm a UX Engineer. I code for a living, but I came to this
    industry a bit later in life.`,
  `Ya see, I am one of the large population of millenials and GenX kids
          that can be labeled 'polymaths'.`,
  `Not necessarily out of genuine
          desire, but out of the necessity to succeed in an American
          education system all geared towards`,
  `going to top colleges and figuring
          out your life's goals before you were even a teenager.`,
  `This had the side
          effects of, for many of us, causing a ton of self-doubt, imposter
          syndrome, and fears of failure if you were not immediately good at
          something,`,
  ` and all the other side effects associated with an unhealthy
          drive for perfectionism.`,
  `For me, this means I have picked up innumerable hobbies, interests, and
          career paths, but stuck with very few for long.`,
  `When I was a kid, I fancied myself to be a tennis pro. I began when I
          was 8 and continued through highschool, becoming state ranked by the
          time I graduated.`,
  ` I stopped playing tennis almost immediately going into
          college. I don't even remember why.`,
  `I then dreamed to become an opera singer going into college.`,
  `I had been in
          school choir since grade school and eventually became state ranked for
          vocal performance in highschool.`,
  ` I decided to go to college for this and
          become a classically trained opera singer.`,
  ` I dropped out after the first
          year.`,
  `When singing didn't work out, I struggled with what to 'do' next.`,
  ` I went
          back to college to figure this out and I eventually had the notion I
          liked philosophy enough that I would become a career academic.`,
  `I stuck
          with this through a masters degree...`,
  `and then realized I had no
          interest in spending my life arguing with predominately old men, so my
          dream of being a Nietzsche scholar in Germany would remain a dream.`,
  `I struggled for a few years with what to do after finishing my master's. 
  Some unexpected events, the life-altering kind, exacerbated this struggle.`,
  `My father fell ill, and I spent a few years driving back and forth from Houston to DFW to help take care of him before he finally passed in 2016.`,
  `My wife developed multiple illnesses that made her disabled, and thus me her caretaker. 
  Since we live in the US, finding reliable employment is essential for getting access to healthcare.`,
  `I briefly dabbled with coding in 2015 while training to become a technical writer.`,
  `I helped manage the WordPress site for the person I was apprenticing with and was introduced to the basics of HTML, CSS, and FTPs for the web.`,
  `In 2017, I saw an ad for a coding boot camp and it finally clicked. 
  This had to be the path to the financial and, thus, health security we needed.`,
  `With the help of my mother, who helped pay for the boot camp, I took that six-month course to learn full-stack web development. `,
  `I won't dive into the issues related to boot camps; however, I was lucky to have joined an organization that wasn't sketchy.`,
  `Still, the only reason I and a small subset of people were successful throughout the course is that I realized early on
    that learning coding or anything in tech,`,
  `was more about learning how to be self-sufficient and fostering the desire to self-research and self-learn, 
    rather than building some kind of encyclopedic knowledge of various technologies.`,
  `This specific skill set (mindset, really) has led me to make this new website for myself, using web tech I have not used before.`,
  `I am putting myself back out there to try to get through our industry's current employment tumult.`,
  `Thank you for reading. Hopefully, this monologue doesn't read as self-aggrandizing,`,
  `more just a look into my motivations for getting into an industry that likes to fantasize about all of us as 'code ninjas' or whatever.`,
  `In reality, most of us like tech, but it's not our entire being, and we are, in fact, 'doing it for the money' as the colloquialism goes. 
   And that's just as valid as any other reason, despite what some may argue.`,
