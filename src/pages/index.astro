        innate inclination, but out of the necessity to succeed in an American
        education system all geared towards going to top colleges and figuring
        out your life's goals before you were even teenager. This had the side
        effects of, for many of us, of causing a ton of self-doubt, imposter
        syndrome, and fears of failure if you were not immediately good at
        something, and all the other side effects associated with an unhealthy
        drive for perfectionism.`
