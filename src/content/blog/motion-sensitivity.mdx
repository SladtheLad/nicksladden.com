# What is Motion Sensitivity? How to Design Accessible Web Animations

## published by [Elizabeth Meshioye](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/elizabeth/) on FEBRUARY 7, 2024

As I've been dipping my toes back into actual web dev and not just obsessing over the minutiae of how a button works in a design system... I've really noticed a glaring problem in the current state of landing pages and web projects in general.

TOO MUCH MOTION

Seriously, too much.

It's honestly astonishing and unfortunate in so many respects (not least of which the accessibility concerns) that so much of what gets passed around these days by designers and UX/Design engineers is just flashy animations and drawings.

I get it. It looks fun and cool, and there's a lot of technical nuance to achieving these experiences... but I guarantee that you do not need to bloat your new SaaS page with +80% or more of animations and graphics.

It's overwhelming to soooooo many neurodivergent and disabled people.

Please, just stop.

Most of the web begs you to, please, chill tf out.
